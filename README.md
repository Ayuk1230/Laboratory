In this laboratory work, I analyzed the data, on the basis of which a classification model can be built in the future that determines whether a patient has diabetes or not. Dataset analysis included:
- Fill in the gaps with the help of ```SimpleImputer```, consider the statistical parameters of the data, compare the distributions of parameters for diabetics and healthy people, build a correlation matrix and determine the most important parameters, and scale the data.
In the course of the work, it was found that, mainly due to the large number of gaps, the dataset has a rather low quality, which will lead to low accuracy of future models trained on it.
# Lab 2
After training our model we got stucked to the last step du a directory problem, which we tried to solve in serveral ways unsuccesfully, by saying this any guide is welcomed to solve the issue as shown in our given second lab work.
